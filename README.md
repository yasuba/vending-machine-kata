##Vending Machine Kata

The vending machine takes an initial load of products and change with denominations 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1, £2.

Once a product is selected and the appropriate amount of money is inserted, the machine should return that product. It should also return change if too much money is provided or ask for more money if there is not enough.

There should also be a way of reloading both products and change at a later point. The machine needs to keep track of the products and money that it contains.
