##Vending Machine Kata

The vending machine, once a product is

selected and the appropriate amount of money is inserted, should return that

product. It should also return change if too much money is provided or ask

for more money if there is not enough. The machine should take an initial

load of products and change with denominations 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p,

£1, £2. There should also be a way of reloading both products and change at

a later point. The machine needs to keep track of the products and money

that it contains.
